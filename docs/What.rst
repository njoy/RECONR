What does RECONR do?
********************

As the first page says:
   The RECONR module is used to reconstruct resonance cross sections from resonance parameters and to reconstruct cross sections from ENDF nonlinear interpolations schemes. 

But the RECONR module does *so much more*:

* Linearization of cross sections
* Reconstruction of cross sections from resolved and unresolved resonance parameters
* Unionization of energy grid
* Addition of reconstructed cross sections to background cross sections
* Summation of cross sections to calculate redundant reactions
