.. _R2D2:

ResonanceReconstructionDataDelivery 
***********************************

The ``ResonanceReconstructionDataDelivery`` object [#R2D2_fn]_ is designed to hold all the data needed for RECONR. Rather than passing a number of arguments to a variety of functions, only the ``ResonanceReconstructionDataDelivery`` object needs to be passed and it can be queried for all the data it posses.

This object is built using a factory builder pattern. The Factory performs the following operations

* Collect all cross sections (e.g., MF=3) and photon production cross sections (e.g., MF=13), converting them to interpolation tables using our `interpolation <https://github.com/njoy/interpolation>`_ library.
* Storing the resonance parameters (e.g., from MF=2).
* Storing the min/max energy values for the resonance ranges (resolved and unresolved).

Once the Factory has collected all the data from the evaluation file (e.g., ENDF), it passes the data to the constructor for ``ResonanceReconstructionDataDelivery``.

.. [#R2D2_fn] affectionately known as the R2D2 object and even has an ``R2D2`` alias.
